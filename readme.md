#Welcome to the Java Coding for FRC Github Page!
*Created by Brad Snurka*

This code base was created as an example to go along with my coding tutorials on YouTube. Feel free to watch any of them off my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJm2d6G5Fg3nbP7CzWRB287k2xbwQx9m2).
I'm not claiming that these methods are the best way to get programming done in FRC but it's how I learned and it's worked well over the past 4 years.

If you have any issues that you can't seem to solve, email me at ************ with you questions and I will try to help you when I have time!

Happy coding!

Brad
