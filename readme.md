#Welcome to the Java Coding for FRC Github Page!
*Created by Brad Snurka*

This code base was created as an example to go along with my coding tutorials on YouTube. Feel free to watch any of them off my YouTube channel.
I'm not claiming that these methods are the best way to get programming done in FRC but it's how I learned and it's worked well over the past 4 years.

If you have any issues that you can't seem to solve, email me at birdgeekthree@gmail.com with you questions and I will try to help you when I have time!

Happy coding!
Brad
